# Arduino Practice

After completing Coursera's [Generative AI for Software Development](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/generative-ai-for-software-development) course, I wanted to apply my newly acquired AI skills in an unfamiliar domain. I settled on IoT application systems, which involve programming microcontrollers (MCUs) and sensor modules. Since code examples for sensor modules are widely available online and likely included in AI model training data, getting AI assistance and generating code should be straightforward. Simple IoT applications, like temperature-sensing recorders, typically require minimal code, making it easier to understand both system operations and AI-generated code.

As luck would have it, I discovered some forgotten development boards in my toolbox, including Arduino systems and Raspberry Pi. I also found various components: an ultrasonic distance sensor module, a Bluetooth transmission module, a servo motor, a stepper motor, and more. Time to roll up my sleeves and get to work!
